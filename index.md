title: Graph Learning At Scale
description: Marius is a system for training embeddings on large-scale graphs. Graph embedding models are used to convert high-dimensional sparse graphs into low-dimensional, dense and continuous vector spaces that preserve the graph structure. Marius is a new open-source engine for learning graph embedding models over billion-edge graphs on a single machine. Marius utilizes pipelining and a novel data replacement policy to maximize resource utilization of the entire memory hierarchy (including disk, CPU, and GPU memory). Using our configuration-based programming model and Python API, data scientists can accelerate graph learning process with Marius.
